% Example Script for MS_AR_Simul.m and MS_AR_Fit.m (run it in the same directory - just press f5)

% This script will first simulate a 3 states MS model with some pre defined parameters
% using MS_AR_Sim.m and then fit the model with MS_AR_Fit.m.

% You can change the coefficients for your own flavor

% You'll see that fmincon() is doing a pretty good job estimating the MS
% model (cheers for it!)
