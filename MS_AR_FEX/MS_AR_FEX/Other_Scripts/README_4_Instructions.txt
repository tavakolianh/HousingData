This folder has some scritps that you may find usefull. 
All of it comes from questions that I've received in my email.

If you have a new request/question, feel free to send it to marceloperlin@gmail.com. 
But please, don't ask me to do your homework.

Passing_your_param0

This folder contains instructions (and m files) for passing you own initial parameters to the fitting function.
I also included a simple simulation script that will create random initial coefficients 
(under the proper bounds) and fit the model to the data.
